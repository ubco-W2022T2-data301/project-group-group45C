# Group 45 - Bike Sharing Data Analysis

- Your title can change over time.

## Milestone 1 - Form Team and Find Dataset

In this milestone you will be expected to choose a dataset appropriate for the DATA 301 project. The most important task for this milestone is to select an appropriate dataset.

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

I usually use the similar system with bike-sharing liek Lime app, so I choose this topic because the study result is apllicable in my life. I mainly focus on how daytime influences the number of bike rentals. I drop `casual` and `registered` column and analyze `cnt` column. Sorting and recording these data, on the one hand, is to make information such as people's pace of life and travel mode frequency transparent. If anyone is interested in this, they can check it at any time, and it can also be analyzed and cited as academic data. On the other hand, knowing people's travel can help the government understand people's life patterns, and use scientific methods to estimate and calculate, and finally sort out data on citizens' use of shared bicycles. From a certain point of view, analyzing and tracking people's paths can now maintain the city's safety in special cases.


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues.

The dataset I analyze is the bike-sharing dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. It records the hourly and daily data of the numbers of bike rentals in Washington, DC between 2011 and 2012. The dataset was created by Dr. Hadi (Fanaee-T 2013) from the Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Decision Support (LIAAD), at the (UCI Machine Learning Repository 2017) and can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset).

The dataset has 2 files with 1 target and 16 features, including both time and weather-related information for each hour on a specific day. There are 731 rows and 16 columns in day.csv and 17379 rows and 17 columns in hour.csv. The data set is univariate and the attributes are integer or real type. The associated tasks of the data set is regression.
