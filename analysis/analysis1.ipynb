    "### Research Question: How does weather affect bike sharing usage in terms of the number of total rental bikes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Context: In this analysis, I will explore the relationship between weather conditions and bike sharing usage. I will use the Bike Sharing Dataset, which contains hourly and daily rental data, as well as weather conditions. I will focus on the total rental bikes (cnt) field and investigate how it changes based on weather conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and windspeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis Plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load the hourly (hour.csv) data into a single dataframe.\n",
    "- Clean the data by checking for missing values and outliers, as well as transforming the data types and column names.\n",
    "- Explore the distribution and correlation of the weather-related fields (temp, atemp, hum, and windspeed) and the total rental bikes (cnt).\n",
    "- Analyze the relationship between weather conditions and bike sharing usage by grouping the data by weathersit and calculating the mean, median, and standard deviation of the total rental bikes.\n",
    "- Visualize the relationship between weather conditions and bike sharing usage using bar charts, line graphs, and scatterplots.\n",
    "- Perform statistical tests, such as ANOVA or t-tests, to determine if there are significant differences in bike sharing usage between different weather conditions.\n",
    "- Summarize the findings and provide insights into how weather affects bike sharing usage."
