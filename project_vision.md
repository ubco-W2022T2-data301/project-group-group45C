# Project Vision

In this project, we will analyze and research variables of shared bicycles. Admittedly this would be a difficult task requiring numerous discussions, calculations, analysis, and failures. Always have anticipation and enthusiasm for what we do, because it could very well be the next A+ assignment, as an example for future students, on your resume. It may also become a document for people to search and learn about shared bicycles on the Internet in the future. No matter what situation we encounter, we can overcome and get through this semester together as a team, so I hope everyone cooperates with each other to create a good group cooperation experience for each other

## Contracted Grade

For this project, we agree to contract for a { A+ }.
