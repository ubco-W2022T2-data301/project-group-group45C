# Project Vision

In this project, I will analyze and research variables of shared bicycles. Admittedly this would be a difficult task requiring numerous discussions, calculations, analysis, and failures. Always have anticipation and enthusiasm for what I do, because it could very well be the next A+ assignment, as an example for future students, on your resume. It may also become a document for people to search and learn about shared bicycles on the Internet in the future. No matter what situation I encounter, I can overcome and get through this semester together as a team, so I hope everyone cooperates with each other to create a good group cooperation experience for each other

## Contracted Grade

For this project, I agree to contract for a { A+ }.
